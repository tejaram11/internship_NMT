1. PROJECT TITLE:
	“Neural Machine Translation for translating to low resource languages.”

3. Details:
   
	Effective communication can be a formidable challenge, particularly when dealing with diverse languages that exist across the globe, numbering over 7,100. The intricacies of inter-language communication necessitate the use of translation techniques. Remarkably, in this era of technological progress, machine translation has emerged as a powerful tool, surpassing human capabilities in terms of speed and efficiency.
Machine translation, though invaluable, heavily relies on copious parallel sentences for its training.
	To address the challenge of applying machine translation to languages with limited or no resources, a transformative encoder-decoder neural network architecture has proven to be effective. This innovative approach enables the achievement of satisfactory translation results with minimal training data for languages like Bengali, Odia, and other Indian languages, and even for languages such as Santali and Manipuri, where resources are virtually absent.
	However, one of the primary hurdles in training deep learning models lies in the voracious appetite for vast amounts of data. This is precisely where the ingenuity of the project comes to light. By employing techniques like back translation, a synthetic dataset is ingeniously created from the model itself, effectively augmenting the available training data and thus enhancing the model's performance.
	The culmination of this groundbreaking work has resulted in the deployment of the neural machine translation model on a web application. The application now empowers users to seamlessly translate sentences from English, a language with abundant resources, to Telugu, a language with comparatively limited resources. This sophisticated web application represents a remarkable advancement in bridging the gap between high and low resource languages, facilitating seamless communication across linguistic barriers.
